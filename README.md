# ML_Predicting_Flights_Prices
In this task, I have to predict the prices of flights on basis of different conditions.
I have run different models to predict the price. 
I have also dumped the model into a file so that I can directly use it by loading the file and I don't have to write the code for the same model again.
I have used Jupyter Notebook.
